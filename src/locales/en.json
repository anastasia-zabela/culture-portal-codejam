    "text": "There are many people who believe that theater is important not only for our entertainment, but also to build up a culture in new generations. Theater is the collaborative form of the fine art which is using live performance to present experience of the imagined or real event. Music, dance, and other kinds of the performances are present in all human cultures. This Cultural Portal has been developed as a Rolling Scopes School project to provide an online resource dedicated to Belarusian theater directors within the framework of preservation of the cultural heritage of Belarus. This Cultural Portal provides detailed information and media about famous Belarusian theater directors, their works, activities, and personal history."
